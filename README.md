## Introduction

Welcome to the Laravel Database Interaction README! This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up your Laravel project, connecting to a MySQL database, and creating and interacting with users, posts, and categories using the Tinker tool.

## Installation

To create a new Laravel project named "app-example," run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel app-example
```
````

## Running the Application

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Connect to the Database

To connect to your MySQL database, use the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

## Migrate the Database

Create the necessary database tables by running the migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Creating a New User and Adding It to the Database Using Tinker

Create a new user and add it to the database using Laravel's Tinker. First, run Tinker with the following command:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

1. Create a migration for the "categories" table:

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_categories_table
```

2. Create a model for the "Category" entity:

```bash
php artisan make:model Category
```

4. Run the migration to create the "categories" table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

1. Retrieve a post with its associated category:

```php
$post = \App\Models\Post::with('category')->first();
```

2. Access the post's category name:

```php
$post->category->name;
```

## Working with the Database

Here are some useful commands for working with the database:

-   **Refresh and seed the database:**

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
php artisan db:seed
```

-   **Add fake data to the database:**

```bash
php artisan tinker
$cat = \App\Models\Category::factory(30)->create();
```

# Notes

    <form action="/" method="POST">
        @csrf
    </form>

-   @csrf -> always have to add it to form, to avoid error 419

-   store
    request()->validate([
    'name' => 'required:max:255',
    'username' => 'required|max:255|min:3',
    'email' => 'required|email|max:255',
    'password' => 'required|max:255|min:7',
    ]);

        public function store()

    {
    ddd(request()->all());

        array:5 [â–¼
        "_token" => "yKum8dfOTzgmil9gdEDs63ROaFftVDta1oPPjGJF"
        "name" => "victor"
        "username" => "braz90braz"
        "password" => "braz"
        "email" => "braz@gmail.com"
        ]

    }

# important to know, laravel doesnt allow send form if it doesnt matched

    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'username',
        'email',
        'password',
    ];

# option is disabled it and add guarded = []

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $guarded = [];
